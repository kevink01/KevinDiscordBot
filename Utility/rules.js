    rules:
    {
        1: `Do not harass, bully, or be disrespectful to others. 
            This includes putting down someone repeatedly and being overall toxic. 
            Any repeated targeting due to race, gender identity, sexual orientation, 
            religious affiliation, or any other protected category which is clearly meant to 
            discriminate, demean, or perpetuate negative stereotypes will result in a ban. 
            If someone asks you to stop, please stop. 
            Doing any of these will result in severe punishment and a possible ban. 
            We allow sports debate here. What we DO NOT allow is if you start bringing serious insults/threats.`,

        2: `Keep topics in their intended channels and stay on topic. 
            Please use each channel for what they are intended for and not shitpost in #general. 
            Each channel topic can usually be figured out by reading the channel name. 
            Please keep all spamming and bot commands in #bots-and-spam only. 
            While this rule is a bit more flexible than the others, 
            we still encourage that you try to keep topics in their appropriate chat.`,

        3: `Please do not ever post anything to do with NSFW/gore etc. 
            This is not that type of server. If you wanna post that shit, go find some other freaky servers. 
            If you do any of this, you will be subject to severe punishment and a possible ban.`,

        4: `Please do not ping any staff or any user for unnecessary reasons. 
            Most users dislike it when they receive a ping, let alone multiple. 
            Only ping a user if you need them. Do not ever ping a staff role without a reason. 
            Only ping them if their presence is required. Intentional ghost pinging 
            (pinging a user then deleting it) will not be tolerated.`,

        5: `#serious-talk is dedicated to any discussion on world events, politics, 
            religion, etc with inclusion of COVID-19. We ask that you try to make that 
            distinction and try to not make jokes, sarcasm, or disingenuity.`,

        6: `Do not bypass try the filter. We know you’re not stupid. 
            We have banned certain racial and homophobic slurs and attempting to say 
            those or modifying them to get past the filter will result in a severe punishment.`,

        7: `Please alert staff if you are bringing in an alt account.
            We’ve dealt with a lot of issues with raids and potential nuking, 
            so if you would like to bring in an alt, alert staff. 
            If you fail to do so, we will kick that alt and punish the original user. 
            Ban evading will result in a ban, obviously.`,

        8: `Do not find loopholes in any of the rules posted above. 
            Staff will use their discretion to dole out punishments. 
            If you feel a rule has been unfairly applied to you, you may appeal, 
            but if you try to get out of a punishment on a technicality, we will ignore it.`,

        9: `Repeated offenses of rules can lead to a lengthy mute, kick, or ban`,

        10: `Please don’t engage DM advertising to members or self-promotion. 
            A first offense will result in a warn. A second offense will result in an immediate ban. 
            Discords are only allowed to be promoted by staff in 
            #discord-partners DO NOT dm advertise or post discords in #self-promotion.`,

        11: `Repeatedly asking for staff in any channel, especially #general, 
            will get you muted and your application automatically declined. 
            More staff are added when more people join, or when some staff members 
            are relieved of their duties. Staff applications will be available then.`,
        12: `Just because someone does something against the rules and gets away with it, 
            does not mean you can get away with it too. Staff have their own lives, as do y’all, 
            and we aren’t monitoring all chats 24/7. It’s possible there are things we miss. 
            Don’t use our mistakes as justification for getting your punishment lessened. 
            People are also on varying levels of punishment. The punishment for a first time 
            offender will not be as harsh as a repeat offender. 
            These are not biases or mistakes, those are conscious decisions.`,

        13: `This should be common sense, but no wishing harm, injury, 
            or death on any member of this server, player, owner, politician, etc. 
            Inflammatory or incendiary remarks made regarding injuries or deaths may result in punishment.`,

        14: `Mentions of rape/sexual assault is banned in every channel except serious-talk 
            and personal-discussion, unless you are posting news about a player, coach, etc. 
            Jokes about it will not be tolerated. There's no wiggle room here`,

        15: `If you are speaking about topics of a sexual nature, 
            and someone who is in chat at the time is uncomfortable with it, 
            and they ask you to stop, please comply. Our goal is to make sure our members are comfortable. 
            We will be a bit more lenient with this rule but if we see it happening repeatedly, we won't hesitant to take strict action.`
