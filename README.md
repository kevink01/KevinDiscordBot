# TalkSportsBot
This is a personal project to reflect my coding skills. 
This is a discord bot that is coded in javascript after self-teaching myself JavaScript. 
The bot is for the discord server "TalkSports", a small community of members who enjoy sports, video games, and other shared interests
**The bot is exclusive to this server.**

Some noteable commands:
1) A snipe command for retrieving the last deleted message.
2) A command to remind users of rules for the server.
3) Utility command for adding/removing/modifying emojis in the guild
4) A pickem command for printing out the schedule of a given NFL week
5) A command for providing account info about users in the server
6) Basic command that replies with "pong"

Also implemented other features:
1) Command handling to prevent certain members from sending the command if they don't meet a threshold (such as required roles)
2) Checks if the user provides the correct number & type of arguments (varies per command)
3) Deleting messages after a given time interval
4) Providing information about a user upon joining (such as which invite link they joined with)

The bot is online 24/7 using heroku, a platform for free server hosting. Any bot development is done on other servers/other bots with cloned repositories.
This project was done all by myself, with a combination of my programming and problem-solving skills, and useful tutorials found on the web. I was not assigned or forced
to complete this project, it was done on my behalf.
